# CCTScripts
## About
This repo is a place where I will upload any scripts I make for [ComputerCraft: Tweaked](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-tweaked), a Minecraft mod that adds programmable computers and turtles. This is mostly random experiments I've made, but there will occasionally be a useful script here.

## Disclaimer
Most of the scripts (such as [screenshare.lua](https://github.com/TheZoidMaster/CCTScripts/blob/main/screenshare.lua)) will need an external program to function (which I don't plan to upload here), will be poorly documented/commented, or be unclear of their use. 

## Usage
([screenshare.lua](https://github.com/TheZoidMaster/CCTScripts/blob/main/screenshare.lua) for example)
1. Download any of the scripts using Wget
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheZoidMaster/CCTScripts/main/screenshare.lua screenshare.lua
```
2. Run the script on the computer
```
screenshare
```

## Contributing
Feel free to fork the repo and submit pull requests if you want a script added to the list or want to add documentation for a script.
